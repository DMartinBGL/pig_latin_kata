# Develop your work so far to preserve the existing capitalisation of the word
# e.g. Dog  -> Ogday
#      cram -> amcray
#
# Assume words either start with a capital letter or don't â€” don't worry about
# other formats

## Tests:

require_relative './helpers/assert_equal'
assert_equal(pig_latin('Dog'), 'Ogday')
assert_equal(pig_latin('cram'), 'amcray')
