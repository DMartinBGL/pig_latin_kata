# Pig Latin Kata

This kata aims to exercise procedural programming skill. Broadly: the skill of
solving problems with code.

Work through each file in order from `exercise_1.rb` to `exercise_6.rb`

They increase in difficulty, from reasonably tricky to quite hard.

Each exercise comes with some simple tests at the bottom of the file. You can
run each file with `ruby` to see the tests pass or fail:

```bash
ruby exercise_1.rb
# Or exercise_2.rb, etc
```

Consider drawing some diagrams to help you understand the problems.
